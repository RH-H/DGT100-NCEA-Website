    <h2><a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/wairarapa/places/castlepoint-scenic-reserve/?tab-id=50578">Castlepoint Scenic Reserve</a></h2>
    <p>Castlepoint is a small beach village on New Zealand's Wairarapa coast in the Wellington region.</p>
    <p>It is home to a lighthouse located near the top of a reef's northern end.</p>
    <p>The reef stretches for roughly a kilometre. Due to its enormous population of seagulls, an island on the southern end of the reef is known as "seagull island."</p>
    <p>Christmas Bay is located on Castle Rock's southern side. Masterton is around one hour's drive from Castlepoint.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In December 2017 the lighthouse was controversially installed with multi-colour LED up-lights which would light the exterior of the lighthouse all year round at a cost of $35,000.</p>
    <p>Many Wairarapa region residents feel the lights are 'gaudy' and a source of unnecessary light pollution.</p>
